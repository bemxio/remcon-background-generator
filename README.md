# remcon-background-generator
A little script made in JavaScript (and HTML, for the template), that generates a background image for the [Remcon 2023](https://remcon.pl) identificator, based on a given image that is used as a pattern.

## History
On the evening of Feburary 4th 2023, as I was scrolling through the notifications that I've got on my phone over the day, I stumbled across a new [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CoNoQFuLJMK/) from [Fundacja BT](https://fundacjabt.eu/), that contained the following message:

> ❗ REMINDER ❗

> Until tomorrow (04.02) up till 22:00 you can edit #backgrounds and nicknames on your IDs in the ticket details. ✍️ We also remind you to pay for your ticket. If the #ticket is not paid by this date, the badge will not have your image but the standard Remcon background. 🖼️

That's when I reminded myself that I didn't set any custom image for my identificator, even though I wanted it to be something related to my signature (aka. `>w<`, the bemxio face!).
It was already past 7:00 PM (3 hours left), and since I suck at image editing I've got an idea: why not automate it? After all, I'm a programmer, so I should be able to do it, right?

And so, at 7:14 PM, I started writing the script. It was quite smooth, since I already had some experience with JavaScript, and I've got the hang of using the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). The only struggle that I had was with rotating the image for forming the pattern I wanted, but I've managed to do it in the end, successfully!

I finished the fully working script at 9:21 PM, and uploaded the background image in the ticket details at 9:23 PM. Overall, it took me 2 hours and 7 minutes (I am quite slow, alright? :P), however I still was happy that I managed to focus on it and finish it on time!

## Usage
Sadly, as it seems from my tests, you will need a web server to launch the website. You can use any web server you want, but I will show you how to do it with [Python](https://www.python.org/).

1. Download and install Python 3.x from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). **Make sure to check the "Add Python to PATH" checkbox during the installation!**
2. Clone the repository to your computer, either by downloading the ZIP file and extracting it, or by using `git clone https://github.com/bemxio/remcon-background-generator`.
3. Open the terminal (or PowerShell/`cmd`, for Windows users) and navigate to the directory where you've cloned the repository.
4. Run `python -m http.server` (or `python3 -m http.server` for Linux users).
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/` (or `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`). 

You should be redirected to an image generated by the script. To save it, right-click on the image and select "Save Image As...".

## Customization
Currently, you must edit the constants in the `script.js` file to change the settings of the script, however I plan to, at least, make an option for providing these values via URL parameters.

There are quite a few variables you can change:
- `BACKGROUND_COLOR` - the background color of the final image. It can be any valid CSS color, such as `#ff0000`, `rgb(255, 0, 0)`, `hsl(0, 100%, 100%)`, `red`, etc.
- `IMAGE_COLOR` - the color of the image that is used as a pattern. It can only be a valid hex color, such as `#ff0000`. All other values will probably result in the website hanging.
- `ROTATION` - the angle (in degrees) of the image that is used as a pattern. It must be a value between 0 and 360.
